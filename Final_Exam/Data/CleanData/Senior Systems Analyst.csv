Accomplishments  I had the opportunity to participate on a delicate project that involved some legal obligations and automation of payment to several suppliers. We had to guarantee that several different acquirement processes entered automatically on their correct approvement workflows. Almost 60% of the company's payments are now able to be processed automatically.    Skills Used  MS Project, SAP-FI, SAP-MM. && Responsibilities  My main responsibility at this job was the delivery of a series of improvements to a custom logistics software to a Brazilian company called Petrobras Distribuidora. It was a very small team (2 persons) so I had multiple responsibilities: requirement analysis, modelling and development. Testing was done by the other team member and deployment was responsibility of another team.    Accomplishments  I believe this was the most relevant job I've ever done because it had a major result on the clients operations. The main improvement made had to be timing efficient as the client had a small window of time between the appearence of the necessity and the actual response he had to do into the system, and we managed to elaborate an efficient one-page-does-it-all pure Javascript interface that enabled him to achieve these goals within the desired time frame.    Skills Used  Java, Javascript, Websphere Portal, OpenStreetMap. We also had to interface with a pre-existing genetic programming service and I had to study it so we could uncover some of the bugs that needed fixing. Also, it was an almost 100% self managed position. && Responsibilities  During this time I had my responsibilities shared in two projects: I became coordinator on a .NET software factory for Brazilian oil company Petrobras on a team with 5 developers. Also, I became technical leader on the previous project (software factory for Transpetro) on a team with around 12 members.    Accomplishments  During this time I was also going through my MBA in Project Management and was able to apply some of my recently acquired skills into my new activities. I had the opportunity to guarantee that the team met the negotiated deadlines and could achieve that by working both as a developer as a team leader and also organizing the team activites.    Skills Used  Java, C#, Javascript, MS Project, MS Project Server, MS Sharepoint were the technical skills and tools I worked on the period, and I had a big opportunity to develop my organizing skills applying it to both myself and the rest of the team. && Responsibilities  Responsible for both requirement analisys and programming of Java web applications and maintenance of a Weblogic Portal application at a software factory for a Brazilian logistics company called Transpetro.    Accomplishments  During my time in these activities I became a technical reference to the team on front end development (mainly Javascript) and could learn and develop my Java abilities.    Skills Used  Java, Javascript, Weblogic Portal and Oracle PL/SQL were technical skills that I was able to develop. I also got to improve my discipline and organization. && Responsibilities  Mainly web development in ASP at a software factory building custom systems to Brazilian oil company Petrobras.    Accomplishments  As my first job, I was able to learn a lot, specially doing maintenance on legacy systems that had poor (or zero) documentation. It required a lot of reverse engineering to elucidate business rules that, sometimes, even the client didn't know anymore.    Skills Used  ASP, Javascript and Oracle PL/SQL were technical skills that I was able to develop. I also got to improve my discipline, resilience and determination.","April 2012 to Present && November 2011 to March 2012 && January 2010 to October 2011 && December 2006 to December 2009 && December 2003 to November 2006","Systems Analyst && Senior Developer && Consultant && Analyst Programmer && Internship","Rio de Janeiro, RJ","Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) Rio de Janeiro, RJ && Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro, RJ","2009 to 2010 && 2001 to 2007","MBA in Project Management && Bachelor in Computer Science","None"
