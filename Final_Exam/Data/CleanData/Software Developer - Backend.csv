I developed a CRM which handled everything from automatically quoting customers, production control, invoicing and accounts. After a year I got so busy I had to take on staff and move into a factory. At one stage I had 8-10 staff members and 3 printing presses. The CRM I had developed really kicked in now, it was easy for the staff to learn and made us incredibly competitive going up against companies still using manual systems.    We had a demand for printing plain labels but struggled to find a reliable supplier, so I started up another company called Stick-It Labels. We became a respected supplier to other lithographic printers across the UK.  I sold the company a year later for £75,000 and ended up with a great supplier, so it worked out perfectly.    The sale of Stick-it Labels enabled me to purchase a larger factory.

Project Details:    Project # 2: Allocation    Customers: Sainsburys, Lojas, Loblaw, Mills, Advanced Stores  Database Server: Oracle 10g  Team Size: 5  Duration: Jun'08 - Aug'11  Role: Test Lead    Description: The most important physical asset of all retailers is Inventory. An accurate amount of inventory can make the business just as fast as incorrect inventory can ruin it. 'Allocating' this inventory accurately is a critical process as it ensures that the retailer has ""the right amount of the right products in the right places at the right time"".    The main challenges all retailers face while allocating products are identical, irrespective of whether they trade fashion items or groceries or whether they have a single store or five thousand stores. They fancy a well-organized, perfect method of translating their complicated merchandise plans into store level allocations.    Effectively allocating products is a vital step in the product life cycle management as this is the last chance the retailer gets to send the right product to the right location. If this allocation of goods is done properly, it ensures that the correct amount of the products land up in the right places. On the other hand, if it is done poorly, it can lead to stock outs and lost sales for some items while other items incur high levels of inventory costs by sitting on the shelves of stores and warehouses resulting in consequent returns or clearances.
