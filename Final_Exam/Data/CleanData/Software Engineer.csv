My main responsibilities are the maintenances of MPLS protocol on Datacom network switches using C programming language for Linux embedded systems and development of test automation  scripts using Python and/or unit tests in C. To achieve our goals we use agile methods, like Scrum, Kanban and standup meetings, and a Linux development environment with eclipse, vim, SeaScope, wireshark, gdb, git and BugZilla. Also, for the development of an entire FW version, I  was in the role of Code Integrator, were I was responsible for merging the fixes made by the team in a common branch, testing them and checking if the fixes didn't introduce another failure. If this happens, I should analyze and debug the code, assuring the quality of the changes made by the team.  Currently working on the project of a new firmware, based on an Operational System architecture, where modules are developed by different teams and grouped later. This is being done in C++. In this project, I'm in the role of developer and also Scrum Master, helping the team to achieve its goals. && I’ve participated on the project OpenScape Desktop Client (ODC), a softphone from Siemens, where I’ve started doing modifications on graphical interface and later I was the only responsible and maintainer of the communication core of the program, containing three modules, named SIP Engine, MSIWrapper and SoftOLA. The first two modules were responsible for establishing a phone call using SIP protocol and streaming media to the other participant (audio using RTP, RTPS and video using H.263 or H.264). The latest module makes the communication with Siemens PABX, using H.323 protocol. I was also responsible for maintaining the interface between these modules and the ODC user interface.   To perform this work, I used VisualStudio 2005 and 2010, C#, Managed C++, standard C++, C and boost library. To debug and understand problems, I used a lot wireshark to check the message flow, log files generated by the program and core-dump to check stack traces. && On this period of time, I was the interface between Husim users in Munich and development team in Curitiba. My main task was to help the users to identify the problems, checking if it was from a wrong test script, from Husim, from PABX or from the phones. Another task was to help  users to develop or improve test scripts, analyzing their scenario and proposing the best solution for them. && I worked with Husim team in Curitiba, hired by a third-party company from April 2003 until March 2006, and from this date on as a Siemens employee. The projects I worked on were:  • Husim tools – These tools were developed in C and was responsible for compiling a script written in Husim language to simulate phone endpoints, sending the script to Husim Server, collecting the results, translating the result from byte codes to human readable text (phone display information by example) and comparing it to a good case checking if some error happened.  • Husim 5.0 – It was the core of Husim, this project was the evolution of Husim 4, and consisted of a board named HIGate plugged as a main controller of a PABX shelf, interfacing with other peripherals boards on the same shelf and the Husim server located in a Linux PC. The Husim server was developed in C and its graphical interface in GTK. It acts as the brain of Husim, receiving the scripts and controlling the execution by sending the commands to be executed on HIGate.  • Integrated Test Controller (iTeC) – developed in java as a server – client program, using CORBA to communicate between them and MySQL as database, it was a graphical interface designed to control a scenario test execution, by calling the husim tools to each test on the scenario.  • Husim Eclipse Plugin – a plugin made to run Husim scripts directly from eclipse IDE  • Integrated Test Manager (iTeM) – The evolution of iTeC. This program was made on java and used MySQL to store all relevant information about the tests. This program was a complete quality assurance manager.It was possible to insert requirements for a project, create a test plan, a test execution, versions of it, which feature should be tested in a specific version, generate reports and, of course, execute manual or automatic Husim tests, as iTeC did.  • Husim 5.5 – Evolution of Husim 5.0. The GUI was redesigned in java and detached from the server. Starting at this version the GUI would run in any computer and connect to a remote Husim Server.   • Husim API – An API made in java, to create scripts using java or any script language that uses java. The officially supported script language was groovy. Also the Husim tools were ported to java, so the execution was made directly from iTeM or Eclipse.  • SimClient HFA and SimClient SIP – Two applications designed to simulate softphones, using h323 protocol or SIP protocol.
