To test the code, the team used to use NUnit and Sikuli. The application was a legacy system with a quite coupled code and also it was developed for a specific kind of machine, so, for that reason, it was not so easy to apply some automated tests on that, but, the team applied what was possible and the project achieved a good level of quality.
