To test the code, the team used to use NUnit and Sikuli. The application was a legacy system with a quite coupled code and also it was developed for a specific kind of machine, so, for that reason, it was not so easy to apply some automated tests on that, but, the team applied what was possible and the project achieved a good level of quality. The purpose of the application was to diagnostic the mechanical and electronic engineering of the trucks assembled at Renault Trucks (Volvo Company) in Lyon - France.

For the project, the team used the FIT tool to automate the tests and with that, the project achieved a high level of quality, also using CI (Continuous Integration) with Sonar and some techniques like TDD and BDD was essential to start the project in a successful path. There were other interesting projects with this kind of business, particularly in the investment-banking context. In all projects the team used to work following agile techniques and some “mainstream” techniques as DDD (Domain Driven Design), TDD (Test Driven Design), BDD (Behavior Driven Design), XP (extreme programming) and the last but not the least in importance, the framework SCRUM that really help us to deliver good quality software.
