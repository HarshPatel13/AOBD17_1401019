The Repository includes four submissions for the project undertaken for the courses 'Machine Learning' and 'Algorithms and Optimization for Big Data' and the code for final exam submission as well as the data.

Project - 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Leveraged Python to develop an algorithm for generating missing portions of images (similar to how humans identify whole images from their halves) using the concepts of probabilistic PCA and deep neural networks.
Conecepts Used: Unsupervised Learning, Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Final Exam -
Recommendation Systems: An approach to building a career navigator. User of application can either provide his/her skill-set and get job recommendation or provide an aspired job and get skill-sets recommendation.
Concepts Used: Big Data, Collaborative Learning, Machine Learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
